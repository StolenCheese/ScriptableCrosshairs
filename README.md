# ScriptableCrosshairs
An open system of dynamic crosshairs for Unity

To insert this as a package, use this git url:

<code>https://github.com/StolenCheese/ScriptableCrosshairs.git?path=/Packages/scriptablecrosshairs#Packaged</code>

Current Features:
* Layer based crosshair editor
* Runtime crosshair editing
* 12 Example crosshairs with sprites from [Kenny.nl](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/crosshair-pack)

Things I want to add:
* Dynamic crosshair placement for world space targeting
* Better demo scene with simple turret and fps
