# ScriptableCrosshairs
An open system of dynamic crosshairs for Unity

Current Features:
* Layer based crosshair editor
* Runtime crosshair editing
* 12 Example crosshairs with sprites from [Kenny.nl](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/crosshair-pack)

Things I want to add:
* Dynamic crosshair placement for world space targeting
* Better demo scene with simple turret and fps
